# The-Arm-of-R2D2

Our 24-hour R2D2-inspired robotic arm tackles accessibility and smart home applications. Using OpenCV, YOLOv5, and Arduino, we enable precise object recognition and motion control for people in need.

The arm is able to perform object detection and classification tasks.

Requirement: CPP, Python, Torch, OpenCV
The arms look like below (We forgot to take pictures of the working demo and now it is disassembled):

We used 3 3d printers for the components
