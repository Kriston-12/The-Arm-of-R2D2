# The-Arm-of-R2D2

Our 24-hour R2D2-inspired robotic arm tackles accessibility and smart home applications. Using OpenCV, YOLOv5, and Arduino, we enable precise object recognition and motion control for people in need.

Requirement: CPP, Python, Torch, OpenCV
The arms look like below (We forgot to take pictures of the working demo and now it is disassembled):
